# UFOs

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to provide data on UFO sightings across the world. Here, I will include filter criteria of the date, city, state, country and shape of the UFO/UFO sighting to allow users the opportunity to narrow down specific UFO sightings.

## Results

With the additional criteria some users might initally filter down the criteria with the most options first. For example, users will probably preform searches using country > state > city to trim their options ! [UFO-Sighting-Search.png] (Images/UFO-Sighting-Search.png) (yellow background). Next if users want more specific data, they will use the date and shape criteria to seek a single or many specific UFO sightings for their research !

## Summary

One drawback of this new design is that users may get tunnel vision regarding searching for UFO sightings. If the sighting they seek to search does not appear, they may believe it was removed due to government conspiracy. Two recommendations for further development are to include the duration and the number of people who reported the UFO sighting.
